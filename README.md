# Book_Library_Management
## In this project I build REST APIs for a Library Management System Project using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), and MySQL database.
I'll create a simple version of the Library Management System with basic functionalities:
Create a new User
Fetch all the Users
Add new book
Fetch all the books
Fetch specific book
Delete a book
Borrow a book
Return a book
